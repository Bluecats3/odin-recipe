    <h1>Firestone a Pizza My Heart</h1>
    <img src="pizza1.jpg"alt="pizza image">
    <p>You know brick oven pizza tastes delicious. But why is it so much better than other types of pizza? Preparing pizza in a brick oven is indisputably superior because of the way it cooks. Nothing else tastes quite like it.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Make the Dough</h3>
            <p>Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Knead the Dough</h4>
            <p>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Divide</h4>
            <p>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Crust</h4>
            <p>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add the Toppings</h4>
            <p>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Time to Bake!</h4>
            <p>Bake in the stone oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Enjoy with fresh grated parmesan!</h3>
